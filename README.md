# Wath Is Weather Like
<small>freeCodeCamp intermediate front end development local weather project<small>

<p>The <span>WIWL</span> app gives you the current weather and the temperature (you can easily toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit with the switch at the bottom of the app), humidity and wind values and also provides a 4-days weather forecast for the desired location.</p>
<p>The app will ask your permission to use your current location.<br> If you deny the permission, or if your device does not support the Geolocation API, you will be able to search the desired place name.<br> To obtain updated weather info, or to search the weather for another place, you have to click on the refresh icon at the bottom of the window.<br>The app's icons are based on the 'Simple Weather Icons' library by <a href="http://www.danvierich.de/weather/" target="_blank">Daniel Vierich</a><br>Weather data source: <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a></p>

<p>The live demo can be found at <a href="https://dem-s.github.io/wiwl/">https://dem-s.github.io/wiwl/</a></p>.
